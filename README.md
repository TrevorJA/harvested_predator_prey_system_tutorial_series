# harvested_predator_prey_system_tutorial_series
Contains scripts used to explore the dynamics of a harvested predator prey system.

This tutorial series is inspired by the work of Hadjimichael, Reed, and Quinn (2020), [_Navigating Deeply Uncertain Tradeoffs in a Harvested Predator-Prey System_](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/4170453/).

A series of blog posts have been written to guide the user through the tutorial, and can be accessed at [https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/).
