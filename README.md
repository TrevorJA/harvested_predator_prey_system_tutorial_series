# harvested_predator_prey_system_tutorial_series
Contains scripts used to explore the dynamics of a harvested predator prey system.

This tutorial series is inspired by the work of Hadjimichael, Reed, and Quinn (2020), [_Navigating Deeply Uncertain Tradeoffs in a Harvested Predator-Prey System_](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/4170453/).

A series of blog posts have been written to guide the user through the tutorial, and can be accessed at [https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/).

## Overview of tutorial series
### Post 0: Introduction to Predator-Prey System Dynamics

The first post in the tutorial series, [accessible at this link](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2022/07/11/__trashed-3/) focuses on the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which define the predator-prey system.
A predator-dependent variation of the classic Lotka-Volterra equations is used, predator interference and harvesting are also considered.

Stability conditions are derived, and an interactive Jupyter Notebook widget is used to explore the various stability conditions resulting from different parameter value combinations (.gif demonstration shown below).
